# tg2obsidian

## Preamble

Obsessed with Telegram (three-letters project) privacy issues but binded with it your life or have favourite bloggers that don't use secure services? With this script you can **make a migration of some channel or saved messages** to your local knowledge system with a single command.

This script parses output from Telegram channel and converts each post to post in markdown, files used in Obsidian and [other note-taking apps](https://www.markdownguide.org/tools/) that use Markdown (Joplin, Simplenote)

Telegram Desktop creates JSON file, as well as different directories containing
multimedia, photos, etc. This script creates new directory and populates it with
formatted posts ready to publish.

you can choose what data you want to export. The script currently supports
only photos, voice messages and audio files.

In format menu you should specify 'Machine-readable JSON' file and then
locate to directory of your desire.

To convert your posts to markdown files you need to run `tg2md.py` program
which takes path to folder that contain `result.json` file as first argument.

```console
$ python main.py path/to/
```

By default it will create `formatted_posts` directory in your current directory
and populate it with markdown files. If you want to specify other location,
use `--out-dir` flag

```console
$ python main.py path/to/ --out-dir path/to/post/output
```
