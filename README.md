## Preamble

Concerned with Telegram (three-letters project) privacy issues but binded with it your life or have favourite bloggers that don't use secure services? With this script you can **make a migration of a channel or saved messages** to your local knowledge system with a single command.

This script parses output from Telegram channel and converts each post to post in markdown, files used in Obsidian and [other note-taking apps](https://www.markdownguide.org/tools/) that use Markdown (Joplin, Simplenote)

Telegram Desktop creates JSON file, as well as different directories containing
multimedia, photos, etc. This script creates new directory and populates it with
formatted posts ready to publish.
